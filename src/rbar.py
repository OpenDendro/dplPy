# Title: rbar.py
# Description: Contains functions for finding best interval of overlapping series over a long
#              period of years, and calculating rbar constant for a dataset over this best
#              period of overlap
#
# example usage: 
# >>> import dplpy as dpl 
# >>> data = dpl.readers("../tests/data/csv/file.csv")
# >>> rwi_data = dpl.detrend(data, plot=False)
# >>> start, end = dpl.common_interval(data)
# >>> rwi_rbar = dpl.rbar(rwi_data, start, end, method="osborn")

    for i in range(num_years):  # effectively, looping over from 1 to the maximum length of the series in the data as potential lengths of a common interval block
        # define a block size, using smaller and smaller blocks as you get toward the last year of the series ... this loop therefore gets shorter as block size i gets larger ...
