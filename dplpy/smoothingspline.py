# Description: This contains the spline method which fits a series to
#              a spline curve.
# example usage (in other file):
# from smoothingspline import spline
# yi = spline(series)

from math import cos
from math import pi
from csaps import csaps

# Returns the spline parameter, given amplitude of the series and the period
def get_param(amp, period):
    freq = 1/period
    spline_param = 1/(((cos(2 * pi * freq) + 2) * (1 - amp)/(12 * amp * (cos(2 * pi * freq) - 1) ** 2))+ 1)
    return spline_param

# Fits a curve to the series given as input and returns the y-values of the curve
def spline(x, y, period=None):
    if period == None:
        period = len(x) * 0.67
    
    p = get_param(0.5, period)
    yi = csaps(x, y, x, smooth=p)
    return yi
